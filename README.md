This is work in progress and highly beta.

Onshape CAD Data is here: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/7a2b90e013ddb4f790097381/w/de934a112d86b578c597cdf9/e/dd9aa8bcdc6310fd48dbadf3?renderMode=0&uiState=67277172a141ee1e785db69c

=======
This is a mix of multiple projects:

- LumenPnP
  - Basic Idea and Toolhead Design
  - Valves, 260mm Belt, Nema 11 Rotation Motors (later switched to Juki style from Robotdigg)
  - Cameras & ring-lights
  - Staging plate (modified to measure 90x470)
  - Photon feeder support
  - Datum board & mount

- Voron Trident 350mm
  - Frame Kit (plus a few uncritical saw cuts and blind joint holes using jigs) and Panels
  - X/Y Motors, Belts, MGN12 and MGN9 Rails for X/Y
  - Nema14 stepper motor (17HS08-1004S)
  - Split toolhead carriage design and XY joint design
  - X/Y Drag Chains
  - Idlers (BFI)
  - D2F homing switch PCB
  - Rubber feet
  - DIN Rails
  - Screws & Misc Hardware
  - Belt routing idea (plus some inspiration from VzBoT-330)

Other Parts used:
- Festo CRVZS-0,4 (Used on ebay)
- MGN9C 100mm Rails (CNA on AliExpress)
- Nema17 stepper motor with 20mm thickness (Stepper-Online)
- 500mm length extrusions with V groove for LumenPnP feeder compatibility


Mechanically compatible to LumenPnP feeders
